# Privacy Policy
I care deeply about privacy. I don’t track you, store personal data, or sell information to advertising companies. I believe that your personal data belongs to you, so all the information you provide to the App is stored locally or in your iCloud drive.
<br>

## What TradingFlow App does do
- Optionally, access to your photo library to pick, copy a picture and store it locally or in your iCloud drive as financial instrument illustation.
<br>

## What your device may do
- Optionally, if your device is set to share anonymised usage data to Apple, I receive some of that information. (Essentially just crash reports, and tells me what devices and versions of the operating system are used)

You can read more about the data Apple collects here: <https://apple.com/privacy>
<br>

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.

All the best,<br>
